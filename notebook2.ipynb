    "### Text cells\n",
    "In a notebook, each rectangle containing text or code is called a *cell*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text cells (like this one) can be edited by double-clicking on them. They're written in a simple format called [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to add formatting and section headings.  You don't need to learn Markdown, but you might want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you edit a text cell, click the \"run cell\" button at the top to confirm any changes. (Try not to delete the instructions of the lab.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The only text cells that need to be modified are labeled \"YOUR RESPONSE HERE\" and are right below yellow question boxes. To edit a response, double click on YOUR RESPONSE HERE and type in your answer. Afterwards, run the cell with Shift-Enter.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code cells\n",
    "Other cells contain code in the Python 3 language. Running a code cell will execute all of the code it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code in a code cell, first click on that cell to activate it.  It'll be highlighted with a little green or blue rectangle.  Next, either press the Run button or hold down the `shift` key and press `return` or `enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only code cells that need to be modified are right below a blue exercise box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "Comments are statements in English that the computer ignores. We use comments to explain what the surrounding code does. Comments appear in green after the `#` symbol like below:"
