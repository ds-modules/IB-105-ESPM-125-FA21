    "The goal of this notebook is to get you to think critically about speciation and extinction. This notebook will also introduce you to the usefulness of modeling and simulations for understanding evolutionary scenarios. We are using a Python package call **\"Geonomics\"** that was conceived and created by Drew Hart, a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in Ian Wang's lab in the College of Natural Resources, Environmental Science, Policy and Management Department.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geographic variation**: There is often a geographic component to genetic divergence, because both genetic drift and natural selection are facilitated, and gene flow is impeded, by geographic isolation. Thus, it makes sense to simulate evolution in a programatic way that allows for explicit spatial landscape scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Geonomics* allows the user to test hypotheses and run simulations about populations of organisms while incorporting any realistic or modeled geospatial **layers** of a landscape. The so-called forces of evolution can all be simulated: mutation, natural selection, genetic drift, gene-flow. The result is a very flexible platform to allow prediction of evolutionary outcomes during population divergence leading to speciation."

    "*A model is an abstract representation of a system or process.*\n",
    "* Models are useful because they allow us to precisely define the problem, articulate the relevant concepts, and then provide a means of analyzing data and communicating results.\n",
    "* Models allow us to predict the logical outcomes of how we think a system works and then explore the suite of conditions that vary in time and space.\n",
    "* Because knowledge is always incomplete, and all data needed to build a model are never available, all models require assumptions to “fill in the blanks.”\n",
    "* Most models are used to explore the consequences of our assumptions and hypotheses rather than to represent system structure and dynamics definitively.\n",
    "* When researchers are faced with answering questions in a large and complex system, it is difficult—sometimes impossible—to collect specimen data or conduct experiments at the ideal spatial and temporal scales. \n",
    "* The cost of experiments in time and money is often prohibitive."

    "\n",
    "* **Speciation**: The process whereby two or more species evolve from a single ancestral population.\n",
    "* **Extinction**: The end of a species, although the processes that begin a species on the path to extinction typically occur at the scale of individual populations (i.e. local extinction). A geographic event, marking the final stage of the processes influencing geographic range collapse.\n",
    "* **Mutation**: Changes in DNA sequences of one or more nucleotides.\n",
    "* **Genetic drift**: The occurance of random changes in allele frequency between generations; a relatively weak force because it involves changes in the genetic constitution of a population caused solely by chance, genetic drift can be an important force in small, isolated populations.\n",
    "* **Neutral evolution**: Evolution that is due to neutral processes and *not due* to selection on traits \n",
    "* **Selection**: The change in a population that occurs because individuals express genetic traits that alter their interactions with their environment in such a way that their survival and reproductive success are enhanced relative to other individuals in the population.\n",
    "* **Gene flow**: The movement of alleles within or between populations because of the dispersal of gametes or offspring -- often tends to counter genetic drift and natural selection and impedes genetic divergence. However, importantly, some amount of gene flow, when populations are diverging (admixture) or after two populations have speciated (introgression) is thought to add novel genetic variation on which selection in the new environment can act, and thus actually can lead to increased genetic divergence. \n",
    "* **Carrying capacity**: The maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely, given the food, habitat, water, and other necessities available in the environment.\n",
    "* **Cost distance analysis**: The analysis of movement over continuous space, in which the cost of moving through any location is variable, so that some paths of movement have higher costs than others.\n",
    "* **Locus (plural loci)**: The position on a chromosome where a particular gene is located.\n",
    "* **Gene**: A specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA that is the functional unit of inheritance controlling the transmission and expression of one or more traits.\n",
    "* **Allele**: One of two or more alternative forms of a gene.\n",
    "* **Neutral landscape models (NLM)**: Random maps against which effects of processes that structure actual landscapes may be tested.\n",
    "* **Null model**: The hypothesis of no effect. A proper null model provides the required reference point against which alternatives may be contrasted. A null model may be a pattern in the absence of any mechanism (geological, ecological or otherwise) for which to compare alternative hypothesis patterns.\n",
    "* **Population**: A group of individuals belonging to the same species that live in the same region at the same time. \n",
    "* **Population density**: A measure of the number of organisms that make up a population in a defined area.\n",
    "* **Phenotype:** The physical appearance of an organism according to the individual's genetic makeup and environment. The expression of a particular trait, for example, skin color, height, behavior, biochemical characteristic, physiology, and so on.\n",
    "* **Genotype:** The genetic constitution of an individual organism. The set of genes in our DNA which is responsible for a particular trait.\n",

Other times you will need to *edit the cells as instructed* to adjust the parameters of the model so we can simulate different scenarios. Reading the green `# comments` in Geonomics code will help to understand what you are actually doing during model set-up,  running of the model, and model results evaluation, and for **creating your own scenario** at the end. It is not necessary for you to read all of the `# comments` or code during this Notebook for biogeography, this is what a user of the Geonomics package will refer to while running their simulations.\n",

    "Geonomics is a new Python package that simulates the genetic evolution of species distributed across landscapes. The landscapes can be arbitrarily complex, and can undergo environmental change to over time. Species are composed of individuals, each of which has its own genome. The genes in those genomes can be used to determine the phenotypes of individuals, which can then undergo differential survival because of how poorly or well they are adapted to their local environments - that is, natural selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model operates by iterating through time steps (which you can think of being similar to generations). Each time step, a series of basic biological operations are carried out for all individuals. Over time, patterns of genetic diversity can build up on the landscape. These are what we are interested in studying, because these patterns in real-world species can help us make inferences about important things that have happened or are happening in nature, such as migration, adaptation, extinction, and the like.\n",
