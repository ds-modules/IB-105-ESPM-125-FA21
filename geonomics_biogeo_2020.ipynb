    "# Biogeography Notebook 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to get you to think critically about speciation and extinction. This notebook will also introduce you to the usefulness of modeling and simulations for understanding evolutionary scenarios. We are using a Python package call **\"Geonomics\"** that was conceived and created by Drew Terasaki Hart, a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in Ian Wang's lab in the College of Natural Resources, Environmental Science, Policy and Management Department. **Geonomics gives you the opportunity to build predictions as to how a complex geographical environment might lead to speciation, so is supremely useful in developing biogeographic hypotheses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geographic variation**: As you've learned in lecture, there is often a geographic component to genetic divergence. Both genetic drift (founder effects in particular) and natural selection are facilitated by geographic isolation, while  gene flow tends to be impeded by it (although this is not always the case). It makes sense to simulate evolution in a programmatic way that allows for explicit and different spatial landscape scenarios, just like in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Geonomics* allows the user to test hypotheses and run simulations about how the spatial arrangement and size of populations of organisms while incorporating any realistic or modeled geospatial **layers** of a landscape. The so-called forces of evolution can all be simulated: mutation, natural selection, founder effects, genetic drift, and gene-flow. The result is a very flexible platform to allow prediction of evolutionary outcomes during population divergence leading to speciation."

    "You need to read the **text cells** carefully and follow the instructions. Some **code cells** you will *run without changing*. Other times you will need to *edit the cells as instructed* to adjust the parameters of the model so we can simulate different scenarios. Reading the green `# comments` in Geonomics code will help to understand what you are actually doing during model set-up,  running of the model, and model results evaluation, and for **creating your own scenario** at the end. It is not necessary for you to read all of the `# comments` or code during this Notebook for biogeography, this is what a user of the Geonomics package will refer to while running their simulations.\n",

    "Geonomics is a new Python package that simulates the genetic evolution of species distributed across landscapes. The landscapes can be arbitrarily complex, and can undergo environmental change over time. Species are composed of individuals, each of which has its own genome. The genes in those genomes can be used to determine the phenotypes of individuals, which can then undergo differential survival because of how poorly or well they are adapted to their local environments - that is, natural selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model operates by iterating through time steps (which you can think of being similar to generations). Each time step, a series of basic biological operations are carried out for all individuals. Over time, patterns of genetic diversity can build up on the landscape. These are what we are interested in studying, because these patterns in real-world species can help us make inferences about important things that have happened or are happening in nature, such as migration, adaptation, extinction, and the like.  In the real world, observing these kinds of changes could take thousands of years (depending on the organism), so models help us see these patterns in a much shorter time frame!\n",

    "In the center is a species on a multi-layer landscape that includes a selection layer (above) and a movement and carrying capacity layer (below). Surrounding the landscape is a flow-diagram of the major operations during a time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **movement**: During the movement stages (top-left), individuals move along movement vectors drawn from various distribution options.\n",
    "- **mating**: During the mating stage (top-right), an individual (purple outline) randomly chooses a mate (green outline) from all potential mates within its mating radius (dashed circle). The resulting offspring (dashed outline) disperses from its parents' midpoint along a randomly drawn dispersal vector.\n",
    "- **mortality**: During the mortality stage (bottom-right), deaths are modeled as a Bernoulli process, with the probability of mortality being a product of density-dependence and selection on all traits.\n",
    "- **changes**: During this stage (bottom-left), demographic change events (not pictured) and environmental change events (represented as a series of change rasters corresponding to scheduled time steps, t1, t2, …, tn), take place.\n",
    "Let's think about this in terms of the real world.  Think of the landscape in Geonomics as an island that we can control.  The different layers represent different environmental conditions on that island, like elevation, temperature, rainfall, food availability, etc.  Right now, there is one species on our island, and each time step represents one generation of individuals.  We will use mice (like rock pocket mice) for our example.\n",
    "During each time step, our mice will do three different things: move around (movement), find mates and produce offspring (mating), and die (mortality). The Geonomics model allows us to dictate how our mice do each of these things- for example, we can say that a mouse can only move within 15 meters of where it was born and can only find a mate within one meter of its location.  We can also specify how long each mouse lives, and if certain environmental conditions (like high temperature) will increase their likelihood of death or survival.\n",
    "While our mice are doing their thing, our landscape model will also change based on any predetermined parameters (changes).  Before running the model, we can set up landscape events to occur at certain time steps.  For example, we can say that for every 10 time steps, the temperature will increase by one degree Celsius.  Since we can link environmental factors to mortality, this will let us model how increasing temperature will affect our mice population over hundreds of generations!"
